NOTICE: Exemplum editors are required to read CONTRIBUTING.md before requesting to join as a collaborator. All file edits must be constantly added to the correct branches and directories, and file edits and creations must be limited accurately. The following guidelines must be followed.  
"I" means Jay as in the founder of Exemplum.
These contributing requirements apply to ALL Exemplum repositories.
	 
(1) Closed files such as CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUES.md, and README.md may be edited but edits must be made into a pull request, and I will merge your pull request if the change is necessary. If the pull request is not merged after a week, most likely your edit request has been rejected. However, please check ACTIVE.md to make sure the reason for your request not being merged is because of rejection.
	
(2) If you are assigned an issue, please review it and work on a solution. When you have found a solution, go to the preffered document (FIXES.md for bugs, glitches, and other errors, and TACKLE.md for suggestions) and under the words "PROPOSED SOLUTIONS" add another number (for example, if the most recent solution was S5, yours would be S6) and type in your solution. Make a pull request for it. If it is accepted, I will merge your pull request into the real document (either FIXES.md or TACKLE.md). If it is rejected, your pull request will be closed. Solutions under consideration will remain open but unmerged.
	
(3) You may add new files, but there are specific guidelines as to what branch they will be entered in. If you have received special permission from a manager listed in MANAGE.md to create a file, then you will commit it to the master branch unless what you put in the file has not been approved yet, in which case it should be committed to the proper non-master branch for the proposed file. In other cases, a pull request should be made and it will be reviewed. However, you can contact a manager listed in MANAGE.md for further information if you wish to propose/make an exception
	
(4) Contributors must not attempt to vandalize the site, make unnecessary edits, or delete approved edits in Exemplum. Exemplum "versions" are forked as backups just in case anything happens.

IF YOU WISH TO PROPOSE AN EDIT TO THE CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES, PLEASE MAKE A PULL REQUEST WITH THE EDITS RATHER THAN CREATING AN ISSUE. ISSUES PROPOSING EDITS WILL BE IGNORED OR DELETED.
