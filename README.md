<h1> Welcome to Exemplum! </h1>

   <p> Exemplum is a free and online cross of Scratch 2.0 and 3.0 that runs on JavaScript, HTML5, and WebGL rather than Adobe Flash so that stays after Flash is discontinued in 2020! Exemplum keeps 3.0 upgrades, gets rid of 3.0 downgrades, and introduces new things that were in neither version! </p>

<h3> What is Exemplum? </h3>

   <p> Exemplum is a cross of Scratch 2.0 and 3.0 that contains 3.0 upgrades, such as HTML5 and curved or pointed reshaping, while removing 3.0 downgrades. We also restore some good 2.0 features. We also have plans to add new features as well, such as triangles in Bitmap, a Photomosh extension, and and possibly an Autotracer extension! The idea of Exemplum was created by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/OTSFan203>OTSFan203</a>, and it is completely online and doesn't require account setup! </p>
   
<h3>Can I upload my Exemplum projects to Scratch?</h3>

   <p> Yes, you can upload the projects you made using Exemplum into Scratch! Some features won't be able to cross over - like Photomosh features, if they are added - but things like Bitmap triangles should successfully cross over. All projects made in Exemplum can be saved to your file, however, so you can keep any project! </p>
