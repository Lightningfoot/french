# Welcome to Exemplum!
   Exemplum is a free way to use Scratch 2.0 online. It is still being worked on and is not currently near completion, but a hard draft of Exemplum, one that is usable despite glitches, is due in 2020.

   ### How do I use Exemplum?
           At the moment, Exemplum is close enough to completion to be used - we estimate that you will start to be able to use some features in July, but nothing is known for sure in our current state. If you watch Exemplum, then you will easily be able to track Exemplum's progress. The README file will be updated as time goes on. However, when Exemplum is up and running, it will be published and visible at exemplumscratch.github.io (not up yet).
       
   ### How will Exemplum work?
            Exemplum will rewrite Scratch 2.0's project editor into HTML5, so that it doesn't die after 2020, when Adobe Flash - what 2.0 mods like Sharp and ScratchX run on - will be discontinued. ScratchX and Sharp will not be rewritten, so Exemplum makes the update.
       
   ### Are there any requirements?
           Your browser and computer must support HTML5 (and other HTML5 Player requirements) to run Exemplum. A pdf containing all information on HTML5 requirements as well as a compilation of computers and browsers supporting HTML5 and its requirements is due in March of 2019. Exemplum is free and online.
    
   ### Can I save projects made on Exemplum?
           Since Exemplum doesn't use an account system - it's meant for using 2.0's editor online - the project data isn't saved online. Instead, you have to save it to your file.
